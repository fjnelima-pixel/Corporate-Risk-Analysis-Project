### Corporate Credit Risk Analysis – Sample Underwriting Project

### Objective
Assess the creditworthiness of a sample corporate issuer using simplified financial statements.  
Perform quantitative ratio analysis, interpret trends, identify risks and form a preliminary credit opinion.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Financial statement analysis  
- Liquidity & leverage assessment  
- Cash-flow interpretation  
- Ratio analysis  
- Credit risk red flags  
- Analytical writing  


### Key Ratio Interpretation

**1. EBITDA Margin**
- Stable around 16–18%, suggesting moderate profitability and operational consistency.

**2. Debt/EBITDA**
- Ranges 1.8x – 2.0x: reasonable for a mid-sized industrial company.
- Increasing slightly due to higher debt.

**3. Interest Coverage**
- Between 4x and 5x, indicating capacity to service interest comfortably.

**4. Liquidity (Current Ratio)**
- Declining from 1.6x → 1.51x: liquidity tightening slightly but still acceptable.

**5. Net Debt/EBITDA**
- Trending upward, indicating leverage pressure due to rising debt and lower cash.

**Overall Trend:**
- Revenue and EBITDA growth strong.
- Leverage slowly increasing.
- Liquidity weakening but not alarming.

### Identified Credit Risks

1. **Rising Total Debt:** Increasing from 40M to 45M over three years.
2. **Declining Cash Balances:** Dropped 25% over period → higher refinancing risk.
3. **Tightening Liquidity:** Current ratio trending downward.
4. **Flat EBITDA in 2023:** Operational growth slowing.
5. **Industry Exposure:** Manufacturing sector sensitive to FX, energy costs, and supply chain volatility.

### Preliminary Internal Rating View

Based on:
- Stable operating performance
- Moderate leverage (Net Debt/EBITDA ~ 1.6–1.7x)
- Acceptable liquidity profile
- No major operational decline

A plausible rating range could be **BBB– to BB+**, depending on:
- Industry volatility
- Access to bank credit
- Management quality
- Country/FX risk

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simplified corporate credit analysis workflow:
- Import financial statements  
- Compute key credit ratios  
- Interpret liquidity, leverage, and profitability  
- Identify trends and risks  
- Form a preliminary credit opinion
